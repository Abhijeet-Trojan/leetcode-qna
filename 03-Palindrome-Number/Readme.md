Given an integer x, return true if x is a  palindrome, and false otherwise.

<!-- Example 1 -->
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

<!-- Example 2 -->
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

<!-- Constraints -->
-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
